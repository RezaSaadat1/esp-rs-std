## Dev Containers
This repository offers Dev Containers supports for:
-  [VS Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container)
-  [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace)
> **Note**
>
> In [order to use GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces#faq)
> the project needs to be published in a GitHub repository and the user needs
> to be part of the Codespaces beta or have the project under an organization.

If using VS Code or GitHub Codespaces, you can pull the image instead of building it
from the Dockerfile by selecting the `image` property instead of `build` in
`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. Further customization of the Dev Container can
be achived, see [.devcontainer.json reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference).

When using Dev Containers, some tooling to facilitate building, flashing and
simulating in Wokwi is also added.
